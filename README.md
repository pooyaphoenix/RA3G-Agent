# üß† RAG Gateway with Governance Agent

This project is a **local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system with a built-in **governance agent** that filters sensitive or restricted information.  
It allows you to:
- Load and manage multiple **local corpora** (datasets)
- Interact with the system using REST APIs
- Block or approve queries based on governance rules
- Easily run locally in Docker or manually with Python
