Collectively referred to as the "Parties" and individually as a "Party." 
WHEREAS Cobnect Inc. is a Canadian technology startup providing an AI-powered platform for 
remote home energy audit and sustainability assessments; 
AND WHEREAS the Contractor possesses the technical capabilities to develop machine learning 
models and data analytics solutions necessary to support Cobnect’s machine learning engine; 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants herein, the Parties 
agree as follows: 
 
1. Project Scope and Deliverables 
 
The Contractor shall design, develop, and deliver an end-to-end data analysis and machine learning 
solution to support Cobnect’s remote energy audit system. The scope of work includes, but is not 
limited to: 
 
• Acquisition and integration of relevant open-source and internal datasets (including 
EnerGuide and housing data); 
 
• Data cleaning and quality control, including the detection and handling of missing, 
inconsistent, or outlier values using appropriate statistical or domain-based techniques; 
 
• Performing exploratory data analysis to understand distributions, correlations, and data 
gaps; 
 
2 
 
• Feature engineering, including the creation, transformation, and selection of predictive 
variables to improve model accuracy and robustness; 
 
• Designing, training, and validating multiple machine learning models using appropriate 
algorithms (e.g., regression, tree-based models, ensemble methods); 
 
• Conducting model evaluation using error metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R², and 
selecting the model with the lowest achievable and scientifically defensible error based on 
cross-validation or holdout testing; 
 
• Documenting the model selection and tuning process, including hyperparameters, 
assumptions, and known limitations; 
 
• Delivering complete, clean, and well-organized source code, notebooks, configuration 
files, and other materials required for deployment; 
 
• Developing a fully functional, documented, and testable API interface for the deployed 
machine learning model, allowing the Client’s platform to interact with the model for real-
time or batch predictions 
 
• Providing a full written technical report and summary document that explains key methods, 
outcomes, and final results in a format accessible to both technical and non-technical 
audiences; 
 
• Deploying the final selected model into Cobnect’s production or staging environment, in a 
ready-to-integrate state; 
 
• Offering 10 calendar days of post-deployment technical support.  
 
 
2. Timeline and Progress Management 
a) The Contractor shall use best efforts to complete the entire project within four (4) to six (6) 
weeks from the official project start date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the project must 
be fully completed, delivered, and accepted within a maximum period of seventy (70) 
business days from the start date. Any delay beyond this period shall constitute a material 
breach and trigger the remedies described in Section 6 of this Agreement. 
 
b) The Contractor agrees to actively participate in the project management process by 
attending at least two scheduled progress meetings per week, with the understanding that 
additional meetings may be scheduled as reasonably required, subject to the mutual 
agreement of both Parties. The Contractor shall also conduct a demo session every fourteen 
(14) days to present measurable model improvements or key milestones and shall submit 
monthly written status reports outlining completed tasks, upcoming objectives, and any 
outstanding issues or blockers.

c) The Client shall cooperate in good faith throughout the duration of the project and shall, 
without undue delay, provide the Contractor with access to all internal data, documentation, 
technical specifications, and platform-related resources reasonably necessary to perform 
the services described herein. 
 
d)  The Client agrees to attend scheduled meetings, including regular progress updates and 
demo sessions, and to participate in decision-making and feedback processes in a timely 
manner to facilitate the successful completion of the project. 
 
3. Compensation and Payment Terms 
a) The total project fee is seven hundred fifty million Iranian Rials (IRR 750,000,000), 
payable in the following three stages:  
o Thirty percent (30%), equal to two hundred twenty-five million Iranian Rials (IRR 
225,000,000), shall be payable upon execution of this Agreement and formal 
commencement of the project;  
o Fifty percent (50%), equal to three hundred seventy-five million Iranian Rials (IRR 
375,000,000), shall be payable upon successful delivery of the machine learning 
model with the highest achievable performance, subject to written approval by the 
Client; 
o Twenty percent (20%), equal to one hundred fifty million Iranian Rials (IRR 
150,000,000), shall be payable upon final delivery, full deployment, handover of 
all files and documentation, and formal acceptance by the Client. 
 
b) Payments shall be made to a bank account provided by the Contractor. All transaction fees, 
taxes, and other bank charges are the responsibility of the Contractor. 
 
4. Ownership and Intellectual Property 
a) All tangible and intangible outputs of this engagement including but not limited to the final 
machine learning model and architecture, all algorithms and training logic, cleaned and 
prepared datasets, engineered features, preprocessing pipelines, data transformation code, 
model tuning configurations, parameter files, model cards, documentation, performance 
reports, source code, notebooks, metadata, and all intermediate work products shall become 
the sole and exclusive property of the Client upon full payment for and delivery of each 
corresponding milestone as specified in Section 3. 
 
4 
 
b) The Contractor irrevocably assigns all intellectual property rights in the deliverables to the

the Client’s full legal ownership of the work. 
 
5. Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure 
a) The Contractor agrees to protect and keep confidential all non-public information 
belonging to the Client, including but not limited to technical data, machine learning model 
structures, algorithm designs, source code, data engineering pipelines, internal scoring 
methodologies, training, validation, and production datasets used or shared, the Client’s
